Implement the concept of _Discounts_ in a flexible enough model to deal with various discount schemes such as: 

- 3 items for $1 dollar. 
- 10% off in all Electronics. 
- Buy one, get one Free. 
- Buy one, get the second item 50% off.

What other domain objects would you introduce?   
What design patterns could you leverage?   
Can you make your design open for extension to new discount schemes?  

Modify the _ShoppingCart.calculateCheckoutTotal_ method to consider discounts
while calculating the total amount to pay.
